This software requires three inputs to generate an output excel form where recommended classes for different semesters are listed. 

The first input is the list of courses a student still needs until the student’s graduation, which will be obtained from Degreeworks as a pdf document.
The second input is the prerequisite graph of all the required classes from the students’ track, which can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). 
The third input is the class schedule, which indicates when the student's required courses will be offered.
